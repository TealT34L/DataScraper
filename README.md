# Scraper
Data scraper for storing covid case data
takes data from the FISD covid dashboard website and saves them into a file.
When the file already exists the file is appended to with the new data.

# Organizer
The organizer reads the file and organizes the campuses into different
data structures and then asks the user to enter a specific campus to
analyze and saves the data into a csv file of the name of the campus
